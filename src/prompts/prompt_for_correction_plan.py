prompt = """You are an expert code analyst. Your task is to analyze failed code and its test results to produce a high-level, step-by-step plan for correction. DO NOT write the code yourself.

**Original Problem Description:**
```
{problem}
```

**Failed Code:**
```python
{solution}
```

**Test Failure Log:**
```
{test_result}
```

**Your Task:**
Analyze the failure and create a concise, high-level, step-by-step plan to fix the code.
Your plan **MUST** prioritize fixing the root cause of the failure in the following order:

1.  **Signature & Calling Errors:** First, check if the `Test Failure Log` indicates a `TypeError`, `AttributeError`, `Call Status: False`, or any error related to mismatched function arguments or names. If so, your primary suggestion **MUST** be to meticulously correct the function signatures (name, parameters, order, defaults) to exactly match the original problem's requirements.

2.  **Runtime & Environment Errors:** If the signature appears correct but the code fails during execution (e.g., `Exec Status: False`, CUDA/HIP errors, memory issues), analyze the code logic to find the bug. Pay special attention to hardcoded device names like `'cuda'`. Your suggestion should focus on fixing the specific runtime error.

3.  **Logic & Correctness Issues:** Only after the above are addressed, suggest fixes for algorithmic errors or incorrect outputs.

Output **only** the correction plan as a numbered list.

**Correction Plan:**
