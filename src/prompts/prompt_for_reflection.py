Maximize performance by exploring the following:
i. Autotuning key parameters BLOCK_SIZE, num_stages, num_warps. 
ii. Better algorithmic implementation (e.g., naive softmax vs online softmax vs fused softmax), better memory access patterns and numerical stability. 
iii. exploring all possible operator fusion strategies within the kernel while adhering to resource constraints.
Primary Autotuning Fields (Mandatory)
1. BLOCK_M, BLOCK_N, BLOCK_K
   * Tile sizes for GEMM or other tensor contractions.
   * Larger blocks improve compute density, but reduce grid-level parallelism.
   * Explore wide range of values like:
     * BLOCK: [32, ..., 128, ..., 2048, ...] 
   * Adjust based on memory reuse and L2 cache locality.
2. num_stages=n
   * Controls pipeline depth for kernel execution.
   * Rules for setting this:
     * 1 if no GEMM.
     * 2 if a single GEMM (e.g., GEMM + ReLU).
     * 1 if two GEMMs are fused (e.g., Flash Attention).
   * Optimize for latency and execution overlap.
3. num_warps
    * Controls number of warps (groups of 64 threads) to launch per block.
    * If it is too low then underutilization -> kernel runs slow.
    * If it is too high then register spill happens and shared memory is overused -> kernel runs slow.
    * You must choose a sweet spot by trying out integer range of 1 to 16.
    * You MUST NOT try the range beyond 16, it is NOT VALID. 
Examples of Autotuning Setup
Here's how Triton kernels should be decorated to allow autotuning:
    * key argument indicates the variables that change and trigger autotune to re-run. This is a must argument and you must not miss this.
    * BLOCK_M refers to the chunk of variable M that will be used for compute by a thread at a time.
    * You must ensure that variables used in the triton.Config should not be passed as arguments to the triton kernel.
For example: the following autotune config receives BLOCK_SIZE_M, BLOCK_SIZE_N, BLOCK_SIZE_K, GROUP_SIZE_M, num_warps, and num_stages as input arguments. Hence the triton kernel must not receive these arguments as inputs in the wrapper function. You must comment/delete any such instances.

NOTE: If you face kernel timeout issues, check if Grid and Program ID Mismatch exists or not for example The kernel is launched with a 1-dimensional (1D) grid, but inside the kernel, it attempts to read program IDs from a 2-dimensional (2D) grid etc.

def grid(args: dict[str, Any]) -> tuple[int]:
    # This creates a 1D grid of size (C * D, )
    return (triton.cdiv(M, args["BLOCK_SIZE_M"]) * triton.cdiv(N, args["BLOCK_SIZE_N"]), )

The grid is calculated as a single integer, creating a 1D grid, however the kernel might try to get two separate program IDs, pid_m and pid_n, as if it were a 2D grid:
pid_m = tl.program_id(0)  # Gets the ID for the first dimension
pid_n = tl.program_id(1)  # Tries to get ID for a non-existent second dimension
